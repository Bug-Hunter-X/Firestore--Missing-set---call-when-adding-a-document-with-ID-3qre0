The following code attempts to add a new document to Firestore, but fails due to a missing `set()` call.  This is a common mistake, as the `add()` method only works for collections and requires a document ID. If you want to let Firestore generate the ID, you should use the `add()` method on a collection reference. If you need to specify the ID, use the `set()` method on a document reference.
