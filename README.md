This repository demonstrates a common Firestore error:  forgetting to use the `set()` method when adding a document with a predefined ID. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  This often leads to silent failures, making it difficult to debug.  The solution highlights the importance of using the correct Firestore methods (`set()` for documents with IDs and `add()` for documents without IDs).
